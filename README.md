# WG-Assignment (08/02/2023)

## Brief

The following coding assignment is a challenge based on the automated testing framework Cypress. 

The assignment asks for 10 different user events to be simulated using the Cypress GUI. There was a link to a masterclass on Cypress that thoroughly assisted my progression through the challenge.

The tests themselves are located within the winning.cy.js file and have been commented to show understanding of the new testing syntax.

To run the tests, use ```npm run winning``` however as I state below there I was unable to get all 10 to run at the same time.

## Blockers for review

The primary blocker I faced whilst doing this challenge was that I could not seem to work out how to allow for the cache to be cleared before each instance so that I could run all 10 tests at once.

I noticed in the Application section of my developer tools that I would need to clear the site data in order to test my tests however the max I would be able to do was often 2.

Once I get passed this bug, the challenge could summarized as an enjoyable learning experience and I am proud of how quickly I was able to absorb the content.
